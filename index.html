    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Trinity Lutheran, Christ Lutheran and St. Luke's Lutheran Churches in Grand Rapids are partnering together and with the Greater Grand Rapids Conference of ELCA Lutheran Churches to plan a series of events in observance of the 500th anniversary of the 1517 Reformation.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to host a variety of events that highlight the heritage of faith we share due to the Reformation, yet be sensitive to the divisions and pain that have resulted from it. Our focus is on the life of the Spirit in the church, both Lutheran and ecumenically. All events will be open to the public (some may require an admission fee).</p>

          <p>Hymns both old and new were performed by a mass choir, brass ensemble, and congregational participation in the acoustically marvelous setting of Trinity Lutheran Church. Special guest John Ferguson led a musical journey of faith over the last 500 years. Singers and choirs from ELCA congregations in the Greater Grand Rapids Conference participated in the mass choir. It was a joyous occasion, and an excellent way to kick off a year of remembrances for Reformation 500. See below for upcoming events.</p>
