    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Trinity Lutheran, Christ Lutheran and St. Luke's Lutheran Churches in Grand Rapids are partnering together and with the Greater Grand Rapids Conference of ELCA Lutheran Churches to plan a series of events in observance of the 500th anniversary of the 1517 Reformation.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to host a variety of events that highlight the heritage of faith we share due to the Reformation, yet be sensitive to the divisions and pain that have resulted from it. Our focus is on the life of the Spirit in the church, both Lutheran and ecumenically. All events will be open to the public (some may require an admission fee).</p>

          <p>On October 31, 2016, Pope Francis gathered with leaders of the Lutheran World Federation to observe the 499th anniversary of Martin Luther’s nailing of his 95 Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany, with a service of Common Prayer shared at the Lund Cathedral in Sweden. Luther’s act is remembered as the beginning of the Protestant Reformation. On Reformation Sunday, October 29, 2017, the Grand Rapids area community will share that same Common Prayer service at the Cathedral of St. Andrew with Catholic Bishop David John Walkowiak joined by Lutheran Bishop Craig Alan Satterlee in an ecumenical observance of all that binds us as 21st century people of faith. The Diocesan Choir will be joined by choir members from Grand Rapids area Lutheran churches and others in a shared worship observance that will include homilies offered by both bishops. The greater Grand Rapids area community is welcome to share in this historical worship gathering. Service will be at 3:00 p.m.</p>

          <h4>50 Years of Catholic Lutheran Dialogue</h4>
          <p><em>Catholic Information Center</em></p>
          <p>The 500th Anniversary of the Reformation coincides with 50 years of intentional Catholic Lutheran Dialogue. Dr. Kathryn Johnson and Rev. Brian Daley were members of the ecumenical task force for the “Declaration on the Way: Church, Ministry, and Eucharist,” which identifies agreements already reached in dialogues between Catholics and Lutherans on those topics. The heart of the Declaration is the “Statement of Agreements,” which draws together 32 consensus statements, where Catholics and Lutherans have already said there are not church-dividing differences between them. Rev. Daley and Dr. Johnson will be discussing a more tentative section of the Declaration that identifies some remaining differences, suggesting ways forward to greater consensus and unity. Tuesday, November 14, 2:30-8:45 pm. Please preregister by calling 616-459-7267.</p>

Special guest John Ferguson led a musical journey of faith over the last 500 years. Singers and choirs from ELCA congregations in the Greater Grand Rapids Conference participated in the mass choir. It was a joyous occasion, and an excellent way to kick off a year of remembrances for Reformation 500. See below for upcoming events.</p>
